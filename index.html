<h4 class="main-content--sub.head">Here is a timeline of David's life:</h4>
    <div class="tribute-main"
<ul id="tribute-info">
    <li> <strong> 1920 </strong> - His birthday is December 6th. His mother was a classical piano teacher.  </li>
    <li> <strong> 1938 </strong> - Listened to Dr.Arnold advive, Dave switched his major from as a veterinary student to a music student.</li>
    <li> <strong> 1941 </strong> - While walking into Faye Spanos Concert Hall at University of the Pacific, Dave met Iola Whitlock, with whom he spent the rest of his life in musical and marital partnership. </li>
    <li> <strong> 1942 </strong> - Dave married his collge sweetheart, Lola Whitlock. The pair met at the College of the Pacific where Iola studied drama and radio production. She co-directed a weekly campus radio program called “The Friday Frolics”, on which Dave and a small band contributed the music. At the time, Dave frequently pounded his foot to the beat. Iola asked him to remove his shoes, because the pounding upset the audio balance. The only thing Dave could think to say in response was, “I’ve been thrown out of better places than this.” </li>
    <li> <strong> 1947 </strong> - Dave formed The Dave Brubeck Octet with Milhaud students Bill Smith, Dick and Bob Collins, Jack Weeks, and David van Kriedt, as well as San Francisco musicians Cal Tjader and Paul Desmond. </li>
    <li> <strong> 1949 </strong> - Dave and two octet members (Cal Tjader and Ron Crotty) created “The Dave Brubeck Trio” recordings. </li>
    <li> <strong> 1954 </strong> - Dave appeared on the cover of Time Magazine. When Dave found out he would be on the cover, he was embarrassed. It was 1954, and he was pictured on the cover of Time magazine — only the second jazz musician ever to receive that particular mainstream media recognition. The chagrin came, he said, because he felt that his friend Duke Ellington — who was also interviewed for the magazine’s feature on jazz in the U.S. — deserved it more. </li>
    <li> <strong> January 1, 1958 </strong> - After performing with a variety of musicians, the “classic” Dave Brubeck Quartet was formed, comprised of Brubeck, Paul Desmond, Eugene “Senator” Wright, and Joe Morello, and would go on to make music – and history – together for the next ten years. </li>
    <li> <strong> December 14, 1959 </strong> - “Time Out” was recorded and released, named for its odd time signatures in songs such as “Take Five” and “Blue Rondo a la Turk.” It became the first jazz album to sell more than a million copies. </li>
    <li> <strong> 1962 </strong> - Classic Quartet plays at White House for President Lyndon Johnson when King Hussein of Jordan visited. </li>
